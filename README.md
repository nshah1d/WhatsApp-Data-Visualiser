A lightweight, private, and self-hosted web interface to view your exported WhatsApp chat logs.

It parses raw `_chat.txt` files and media generated by WhatsApp's "Export Chat" feature, transforming them into a beautiful, searchable, "WebOS" style interface with Dark Mode.

## Key Features

* **Zero Dependencies:** Pure Vanilla JS and PHP. No database, Node.js, or build steps required.
* **Privacy First:** Runs entirely on your own server. Your chat data **never** leaves your directory.
* **Infinite Scroll:** Efficiently handles huge chat logs (tested with 500MB+ media folders) by lazily rendering messages and media.
* **Instant Search:** Full-text search across entire chat histories with keyword highlighting.
* **Media Drawer:** Dedicated tab to filter attachments by Images, Videos, or Documents.
* **Smart Parsing:** Handles multi-line messages, system events, and standardizes timestamps using RegEx.

## Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates proficiency in **Full Stack Web Development** and **Data Engineering** concepts without relying on heavy frameworks.

* **Unstructured Data Parsing:** Using complex **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to clean and structure raw text logs into JSON objects.
* **Algorithm Optimization:** Implementing **Infinite Scroll** and **Lazy Loading** to manage memory efficiently when rendering DOM elements for thousands of messages.
* **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Using `fetch / async / await` to build a non-blocking UI that loads data dynamically.
* **Backend Logic:** Using **PHP** for server-side file system scanning and directory indexing.
* **UI/UX Design:** Creating a responsive, "Native App" feel with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables for Dark Mode.

## Configuration (Important)

To ensure the chat interface correctly distinguishes between "You" (Right/Green bubble) and "Them" (Left/White bubble), you must configure your name.

1.  Open **`app.js`**.
2.  Find the configuration line at the very top:
    ```javascript
    const MY_NAME = "John Doe"; // Change this to your WhatsApp Display Name
    ```
3.  Update it to match exactly how your name appears in your exported text files.

---

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Upload the Code:**
    Upload `index.html`, `app.js`, and `scan.php` to any web server that supports PHP.

2.  **Export Your Chat:**
    * Open WhatsApp on your phone.
    * Go to the chat you want to save.
    * Tap **Export Chat** > **Attach Media**.

3.  **Upload the Data:**
    * Unzip the exported folder.
    * Upload that entire folder to the same directory as `index.html`.
    * *Note: Ensure the folder contains the `_chat.txt` file directly inside it.*

4.  **View:**
    * Open `index.html` in your browser.
    * The app will automatically detect the folder and load your chat history.

### Directory Structure

Your server directory should look like this:

```text
/public_html/whatsapp-viewer/
├── index.html
├── app.js
├── scan.php
├── MyFamilyChat/          <-- Your unzipped WhatsApp export
│   ├── _chat.txt

│   └── VIDEO-20240101.mp4
├── WorkGroup/             <-- Another unzipped export
